# NYC_taxi_project

Investigate taxi behaviour in New York City and whether there are specific times and places that primarily uses taxis. 
Further, how tipping behaviour does have any relation to neighborhoods, time or socio-economic.

Plan to investigate this: 

* Initial data exploration: (streamline layout (plotly), add to pages + text)
  * Taxi behavior as function of day of week, month, hour of the day, hour of the week 
  * Fare amount, tip amount, tip percentage of total amount, trip distance, trip duration, pickupp/dropoff location count 
  * Short trip + long trip + outliers + clock plots 
  * Predict fare amount based on trip distance (linear regression) (TO DO!)
  * 
* Interactive plots (TO DO: add background map, update colorbar, make faster compile, add to pages + add text)

* Predict tip amount or fare amount + user interface to just fill in and then predict (TO DO!)

* Add socio-economic data (eg. number of restuarants in zones):
  * Investigate patterns between tipping and number of restaurants in neighborhoods
  * (Add weather and look through a couple of months and look for pattern)

* Preict tip amount adding the new data --> does it add valuable information 

* key take away ind the end and compare with 2019 (TO DO!)
