# NYC_taxi_project

Investigate taxi behaviour in New York City and whether there are specific times and places that primarily uses taxis. 
Further, how tipping behaviour does have any relation to neighborhoods, time or socio-economic.

Plan to investigate this: 

* Initial data exploration: 
  * Taxi behavior as function of day of week, month, hour of the day, hour of the week
*
