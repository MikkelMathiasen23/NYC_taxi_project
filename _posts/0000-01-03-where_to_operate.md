Manhattan is the place to go as this is the starting point for most taxi trips in New York City, but this is also the most frequent dropoff point so you might not be alone in the customer hunting. You might want to go to XXXX as this appears to be a hidden gem of taxi customers, as this is not a common area to be dropped off, but a lot of customers want to picked up here. 
But a lot of customers are not enough - they should also give good tips as this would give better earnings!

You should definitely not pickup people in Bronx or Staten Island as people there gives the lowest amount of tip, but instead you should go for Manhattan, Brooklyn or Queens as people there tend to give the best tips!
