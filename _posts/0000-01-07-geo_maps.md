<sub> On the figure above you can select different criteria: *average tip amount*, *average fare amount*, *tip percentage of the total amount* and *number of pickups*. The selected quantity is calculated for each zone in New York City and then you can use the slider to see how this changes throughout a day. So please dig in, and find the pattern you are looking for - you might find your hidden gem!</sub>
