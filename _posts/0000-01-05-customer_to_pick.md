<sub>There does not appear to be any substantial difference in picking up a group or a single passenger. This applies both for the tip amount and the total amount they pay. So feel free to pickup whomever you want!</sub>

## Partial conclusion
<sub>Not very much to sum up on here. Just pickup single persons or multiple person as you like as they give the same amount of tip. </sub>
