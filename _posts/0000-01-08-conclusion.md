# Conclusion 

We need to sum up what we have learned, and lets keep the structure in *where*, *when* and *who*. 

- Manhattan and Queens have a high demand for taxis and tend to give good tips
- Brooklyn and Staten Island tend to give bad tips
- The passengers tend tip the most 10AM - 3PM Monday through Friday
- When taking the tip pr. hour and distance into account Monday and Sunday are good days to work and not Tuesday
- You can pick up any amount of passengers this will not affect the tip amount 
- Don't speed unless you are asked for it!
