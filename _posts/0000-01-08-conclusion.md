# Conclusion 

<sub>We need to sum up what we have learned, and lets keep the structure in *where*, *when* and *who*. </sub>

- <sub>Manhattan and Queens have a high demand for taxis and tend to give good tips</sub>
- <sub>Brooklyn and Staten Island tend to give bad tips</sub>
- <sub>The passengers tend tip the most 10AM - 3PM Monday through Friday </sub>
- <sub>When taking the tip pr. hour and distance into account Monday and Sunday are good days to work and not Tuesday </sub>
- <sub>You can pick up any amount of passengers this will not affect the tip amount </sub>
- <sub>Don't speed unless you are asked for it! </sub>
