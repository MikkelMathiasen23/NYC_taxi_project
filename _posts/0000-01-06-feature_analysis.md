# Most important factors for earning a tip 


<sub>To learn more about the <u>top 6 most important factors</u> for earning a tip are then press forward!</sub> 
+ <sub>Trip speed</sub>
+ <sub>Trip duration time</sub>
+ <sub>Trip distance </sub>
+ <sub>Dropoff location</sub>
+ <sub>Pickup location</sub>
+ <sub>Fare amount</sub>


<sub>So longer trips with respect to distance and duration appears to be good for the amount of tip! Also the pickup and dropoff location affects the tip amount (we will dig into that on the next slide!). Larger fare amount appears to have a positive effect on the tip amount. Lastly, the trip speed how should you react to find out: go to the slide below. </sub>

You should not just by default drive fast, because it appears has trip speed has a negative effect on the tip amount and this is case especially for Staten Island, Bronx and Brooklyn. Generally, it is apparently not possible to drive very fast at Manhattan so we can't draw any conclusion on that. For driving at Queens it does not appear to have a very big impact on the tip amount if you drive fast, but still it is not recommendable as it have a slightly bad effect.

##Partial conclusion

<sub> To sum up the important factors for determining whether you get a tip: <u> longer trips both duration and distance</u> are good, but also <u> large fare amounts </u> appears to have a positive effect on the tip amount. Lastly, <u> dont speed to much </u> as this appear to have a negative effect on tipping.</sub>

<sub>So now got the *where*, *when* and *who* figured out. The next stuff we will look into is: are there any pattern in the *when* and *where* when you mix it? Do you need to be a certain place at a certain time to catch the right passengers - we will look into this on the next slide. </sub>
