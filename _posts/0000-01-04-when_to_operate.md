<sub>The analysis clearly indicates that the number of customers peak around 5-6AM at Thursdays and Fridays. Clearly this would be the two best timeframes to operate. There appears to be a clear pattern that indicates that the peak hours each weekday 2-6 AM Monday through Friday whereas the weekends are with lower activity especially Sunday. It is also not recommended to operate between 10AM and 7PM as the customer activity are low in this timeframe the whole week.</sub>

<sub>But looking at the acitivity is clearly not enough, because if the customers does not tip well, why should we pick them up? Then we could at least wait for the good customers. So looking into what time of the day results in the highest tip amount compared to the fareamount. By looking at the tip amount this clearly indicates that Wednesday between 1-3PM are the timeframe that results in the highest tip! But again operating between 4-7PM does not appear to be beneficial with respect to the tipping amount.</sub> 

<sub>Well, it looks like a tradeoff between number of customers and tip amount are needed. If we are going for the next best tip amount then this indicates that operating between 10PM-3AM Monday through Friday this results in good tip amounts and lots of customers. Should the weekend also be included in the workweek? Well, then it is recommended to work between 12PM-6AM.</sub>

THIS SHOULD BE FAREAMOUNT/TRIPDISTANCE !

<sub>If you answered no to this question then you should definitely operate around 4-5 AM but instead XXXX otherwise we would recommend operating in the timeframe spanning from 6AM until 8PM.</sub>

<sub>When comparing the two figures, it is apparent that the early trips at 4-5 AM are long trips resulting in large fareamounts. This could be due to people leaving early for the airport or need to travel far for work. If you want to have small trips not leading you out of the city center then you should probably not operate the early mornings.</sub>

<sub>Having investigated *Where* and *When* to operate we should find out *Who* should we pickup. Clearly, some types of people tend to give better tips than others. Lets dig into that on the next slide.</sub>
